# Question 9 (10 Marks):

Write a Java program that performs the division of two integers. Your program should take two numbers as user input and handle the following exceptions:

- **ArithmeticException**: If the user tries to divide by zero, the program should display a message: "Cannot divide by zero."
- **InputMismatchException**: If the user inputs something other than an integer, display: "Invalid input. Please enter integers only."
