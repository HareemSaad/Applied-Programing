# Question 3 (10 Marks):

Create a generic class `Box` that can hold any type of object. Implement the following:

- A private field of type `T` to store the item.
- A constructor that takes a `T` object and stores it in the field.
- A method `getItem()` that returns the stored item.
- A method `setItem(T item)` to change the item in the box.

Write a `main` method that demonstrates how you can create a `Box` for different types, such as `Integer`, `String`, and `Double`.

## Expected Output:
Box contains: 42
Box contains: Hello, World
Box contains: 15.75
