# Question 6 (10 Marks):

Design a class `Pair<K, V>` that holds a pair of objects (a key of type `K` and a value of type `V`).

- The class should have two private fields: `key` and `value`.
- Implement a constructor that initializes both fields.
- Implement `getKey()` and `getValue()` methods to return the key and value.

Write a `main` method that demonstrates the use of `Pair` with different types, like `Integer-String`, `String-Double`, etc.

## Expected Output:
Key: 1, Value: Apple
Key: Name, Value: John
