# Question 7 (10 Marks):

Write a generic method `swap(T[] array, int i, int j)` that swaps the elements at positions `i` and `j` in an array.

- The method should work for arrays of any type.
- Write a `main` method to demonstrate the `swap()` method with an array of `Integer` and `String`.

## Expected Output:

Before swap: [1, 2, 3, 4]
After swap: [1, 4, 3, 2]
Before swap: [Hello, World, Java]
After swap: [Java, World, Hello]
