# Question 5 (10 Marks):

You have a class `Printer` with a generic method `printItems(List<?> items)` that prints each element in the list.

- Implement the `Printer` class and the `printItems()` method using a wildcard `?` to accept a list of any type.
- Write a `main` method that creates lists of different types (`Integer`, `String`, etc.) and prints their contents using the `Printer` class.

## Expected Output:
Items: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Items: Apple, Orange, Banana
