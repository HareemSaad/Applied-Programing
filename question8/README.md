# Question 8 (10 Marks):

Create a generic interface `Storage<T>`, which has the following methods:

- `void addItem(T item);`
- `T getItem();`

Then, implement this interface in a class `SimpleStorage<T>`.

- In the `SimpleStorage` class, store a single item of type `T`.
- Implement the `addItem()` and `getItem()` methods.
- Write a `main` method to demonstrate how `SimpleStorage` can be used for storing different types of objects, such as `String`, `Integer`, and `Float`.
